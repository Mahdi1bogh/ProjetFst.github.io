                <h3><li>No Wasted Time in Learning How to Code</li></h3>
                <p>If you're serious about learning how to code, there are several options for web dev education. You can do a CS degree, teach yourself online, or do a bootcamp. All are great options; it really depends on how quickly you want to get out into the workforce. The benefit of bootcamp is that you can know how to code, and code well, in 13 weeks. 13 weeks! It's an intense 13 weeks, but you will have people dedicated to your success in learning and finding a job throughout your bootcamp experience. Before you know it, you'll be in a career you're finally excited about!</p>
                <h3><li>A Great Income</li></h3>
                <p>According to U.S. News & World Report, certified professional web developers earn an average salary of $64,970 nation wide. Salary shouldn't be the only factor when deciding whether or not to learn web development, but it should be taken into consideration. With the average household income in the United States being $56,516 in 2017, average income for web developers looks pretty nice.</p>
                <h3><li>You Can Work From Anywhere</li></h3>
                <p>Have freedom to work whenever you want from wherever—imagine that. All you need for web development is the internet and a laptop. Not all jobs are remote, but if that is your preference, there are remote jobs out there for you. 

                </p>
                <h3><li>There Are Always Freelance Opportunities</li></h3>
                    <p>If you're the type that likes to work project to project on your own terms, then being a freelance web developer is for you. Once you join the web dev community, you will find that there are plenty of opportunities for you to freelance. Coming right out of bootcamp, you can charge $50 an hour—depending on where you live—for your work. And, that will only increase as you become more skilled. </p>
